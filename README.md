Just walked out—what a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮! The Accountant 2. Zero clue where to start but WOW, still reeling. Noisy theater, sticky floors. Popcorn EVERYWHERE, why do people even. Ben Affleck did that thing again where he’s like a math ninja? Crazy. My back aches from sitting too long, jesus, I'm getting old.

Couldn't hear the first half over some kid kicking my seat. But the action—wild. Bang bang, then math magic, and something about financial crimes? It's like they thought, Hey, let's take math and turn it into martial arts, haha. The whole thing kinda felt like solving a calculus problem while skydiving.

> The lady next to me spilled soda all over, but when that twist came—the one with his brother—everyone went pin drop silent. You could almost hear the neurons firing CGI-style. Mad respect to the writers, no idea how they cooked that up. And why was there a goat?! Did I imagine that? Pretty sure there's a metaphor but man, over my head today.

They keep unraveling these crazy plotlines like tangled necklaces in storage for too long. Jess told me I could just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later, but honestly, I’d 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to understand half of what happened when Michael was in that boardroom with all the secret backdoors and numbers flying everywhere like Tinkerbell on Red Bull.

The car chase! Like a cat on a Roomba, relentless yet somehow… calculated? Got me so dizzy, like twirling way too fast, but at least the soundtrack was a banger. Got popcorn crumbs in my shoe now—such is life.

Not to forget, the bit when Anna Kendrick, oh God, was she even in this? Or am I mixing up  s? Definitely mixing up. Anyway, that part—everyone's jaw hit the floor. Real shocker. Plot thickening like grandma’s old stew, if you know what I mean.

Here's a thought, if lasers could do taxes, would they charge hourly or per form? Detouring there, but damn, that brainwave hit hard during the robotic-assassin scene.

Ah whatever, here comes the Monday brainfried glitchy nonsense:

```
for (int i = 0; i < berserkLevel; ++i) {
--- this comment is useless, but
  balance -= realityCheck[i];
}
```

Gonna go stretch or something. That’s it from me.
